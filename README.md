# IRVINE32 Library For NASM(Port)
    
This project starts to port some of the key functions from IRVINE32 to NASM for MACOS 64bit. Right now we have 5 functions, gotoxy, strLen, clearScreen, writeString, and setTextColor. In the directory clearScreen we have four functions, strLen, gotoxy, writeString, and clearScreen. In the setTextColor directory we have setTextColor.
